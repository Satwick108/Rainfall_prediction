A simple website that predicts rainfall using a machine learning model. Built with Flask for the backend and a trained model for inference, this app provides an easy way to check the likelihood of rainfall based on input parameters.

 *Features

Predicts rainfall probability using a pre-trained machine learning model.
User-friendly web interface with a simple form for input.
Deployed using Render for easy access.
Clean UI built with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

*Technologies Used

Flask for the backend
Scikit-learn for the ML model
HTML, CSS, Bootstrap for frontend styling

* Processes and Challenges Faced

1. Model Training & Optimization

Choosing the right dataset and preprocessing it for training.
Experimenting with different ML models and hyperparameters to achieve better accuracy.
Converting the trained model into a .pkl file for deployment.

2. Building the Web App

Integrating the model with a Flask backend.
Designing an interactive and user-friendly frontend using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.
Handling form input and ensuring smooth data flow between the frontend and backend.

3. Deployment Challenges

Setting up the project structure correctly for Render deployment.
Fixing issues with dependencies and ensuring all required libraries are included in requirements.txt.
Configuring Procfile and debugging server-related issues.
Dealing with runtime errors and debugging logs from Render.

Despite these challenges, the project was a great learning experience, helping to understand the full cycle of developing and deploying a machine learning-powered web
